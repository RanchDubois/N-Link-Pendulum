# N-Link Pendulum

This set of MATLAB scripts allows one to simulate a two-dimensional N-link pendulum in time. The equations of motion are generated using one of:

* Newton-Euler approach (F = ma) with minimal coordinates (polar coordinates),
* Newton-Euler approach (F = ma) with maximal coordinates (Cartesian coordinates and differential kinematic constraints),
* Lagrange equations approach with minimal coordinates (polar coordinates).

p48_ROOT.m is the main scripts, which calls the other scripts/functions. Parameters are set here.
